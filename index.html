    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <h3>My love for technology was reignited when I entered the NFT space in early 2021. Since then, I have been actively teaching myself new mediums, softwares, and methods to help me integrate my current skillsets into the more useful applications within the tech sphere. I am currently working to learn Software Engineering at the Flatiron School, in Denver, Colorado.</h3>
